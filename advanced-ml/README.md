# Advanced ML Pipeline Implementation

## Phase 1: Automated ML Pipeline

### Features to Implement
1. **Automated Feature Selection**
   - Recursive feature elimination
   - Feature importance analysis
   - Correlation-based filtering

2. **Advanced Hyperparameter Optimization**
   - Bayesian optimization with Optuna
   - Multi-objective optimization
   - Automated early stopping

3. **Model Ensemble Methods**
   - Voting classifiers
   - Stacking models
   - Dynamic model selection

4. **Online Learning**
   - Incremental model updates
   - Concept drift detection
   - Adaptive learning rates

## Phase 2: MLOps Implementation

### Automated Training Pipeline
```python
# Example automated retraining trigger
def check_model_performance():
    current_accuracy = evaluate_production_model()
    if current_accuracy < threshold:
        trigger_retraining_pipeline()
        send_alert_to_team()
```

### Model Monitoring
- Performance drift detection
- Data quality monitoring
- Feature drift analysis
- Automated alerts and rollbacks

### A/B Testing Framework
- Champion/Challenger model comparison
- Statistical significance testing
- Gradual rollout strategies

## Implementation Priority
1. Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
2. Model ensemble framework
3. Automated retraining pipeline
4. Production monitoring dashboard
